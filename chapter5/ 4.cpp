Chapter 5, task 4.
Description: Write the program with class for describe vehicle.
Class vehicle has parameters: model, color, volume of fuel storage in litres.
Provide method allow calculate the distance which drive the vehicle, 
using up a full fuel storage (Calculates as multiply on 100 relation volume 
fuel storage to the norm consumption gasoline). 

Based on the Vehicle class, create derived class the truck vehicle.
Addind parameter, describe carrying capacity (The max weight of cargo, 
that can be carried the vehicle). and the method that allow calculate 
cost price of tranportation the one tonn of cargo on one kilometr.

The result of method is calculate as: norm consumption gasoline devided on 100,
multiply on fuel price, and devided on carrying capacity. 
The price of fuel pass by argument into method.

Consider using operator methods and funcs.
